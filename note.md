Part 1: The Creator's Journey (Uploading a Video)
This is the "write" path. It happens once per video.
User Uploads to Your Server: A creator clicks "Upload" on your website. They select a video file. This file is uploaded to your backend server first, not directly to Filecoin. This is a standard web server you control (e.g., running on AWS, Google Cloud, etc.).
Your Backend Processes the Video: Your server can now do important pre-processing work, like:
Compressing the video to different resolutions (1080p, 720p, etc.).
Generating a thumbnail.
Saving the video's title and description.
Your Backend Uploads to Filecoin: Now, your server—using a script very similar to the one we just perfected—takes the processed video file(s) and uploads them to Filecoin. This is done using your platform's central wallet. You've already deposited funds into this wallet and approved the service contract.
Store the CID: When the upload is complete, the Synapse SDK gives your backend the commP (the Piece CID). This CID is the golden ticket. Your backend saves this CID in a traditional database (like PostgreSQL or MongoDB) alongside the other video information (title, description, thumbnail URL, etc.).
Creator's experience: It feels just like uploading to YouTube. They upload, add a title, and are done. They have no idea Filecoin is involved.










Part 2: The Viewer's Journey (Watching a Video)
This is the "read" path. It's designed to be extremely fast and happens every time someone watches.
User Clicks Play: A viewer visits your site and clicks on a video thumbnail.
Frontend Asks Your Backend for the Video: Your website's frontend makes a simple API call to your backend, like GET /api/videos/the-video-id.
Backend Constructs the CDN URL: Your backend looks up the video in its database. It retrieves the stored Piece CID. It then programmatically constructs the FilCDN URL from that CID.
Backend Responds with the URL: The backend sends this complete FilCDN URL back to the frontend.
Video Player Takes Over: The frontend plugs this FilCDN URL into a video player (like Video.js). The player then starts streaming the video directly from FilCDN's global network of caches.
Viewer's experience: It's instant. The video starts playing immediately, just like on any major streaming site. They have no idea the data is ultimately secured on Filecoin.















Part 1: Nail the Core Implementation (The 90%)
This is the foundation. If you don't have this, nothing else matters. You must build a smooth, working prototype of the architecture we designed.
Flawless Backend:
An API endpoint that accepts a video upload from your frontend.
It uses a single, persistent Synapse instance (your platform's wallet) to handle all uploads. It should be pre-funded and pre-approved so uploads are fast.
It saves the returned Piece CID to a simple database.
It has another API endpoint that, when given a video ID, returns the full FilCDN URL.
Seamless Frontend:
A clean, simple upload page.
A gallery or main page that displays thumbnails of all uploaded videos.
When a user clicks a video, it loads into a player and instantly begins streaming from the FilCDN URL provided by your backend. The key is to make this feel incredibly fast.
Getting this end-to-end flow working smoothly is 90% of the battle and fulfills all the hackathon's core requirements.







Part 2: Add the "Wow" Factor (The 10% That Wins)
Everyone will try to build a basic version of Part 1. You need to add one killer feature that shows you're thinking bigger and pushing the technology to its limits. Do one of these, and do it well.
The "Low Latency" Champion Idea: Live Streaming
What it is: Instead of just uploading pre-recorded videos, build a basic live streaming function. A creator can "Go Live," and their stream is segmented into small chunks (e.g., 2-second clips). Your backend uploads each chunk to Filecoin/FilCDN as it's created. Viewers watch the stream with a slight delay, with the player fetching the newest segment as it becomes available.
Why it wins: This is the ultimate demonstration of low-latency. It's technically impressive and shows you can handle real-time data, which is a huge challenge. This directly hits the "low latency application" theme harder than anything else.
The "Web3 Vision" Idea: Creator Monetization
What it is: Add a "Tip Jar" to each video. Using a simple MetaMask integration on the frontend, a viewer can send a tip (in testnet USDFC or tFIL) directly to the creator's wallet address (which you would store alongside the video info).
Why it wins: This shows you're not just building a tech demo; you're building a platform with a business model. It showcases the true power of Web3—cutting out the middleman and enabling direct creator-to-audience payments. It tells a powerful story.
The "Professional Polish" Idea: Adaptive Bitrate Streaming
What it is: When a video is uploaded, your backend doesn't just save one file. It uses a tool like FFmpeg to create multiple versions (1080p, 720p, 480p). It uploads all of them and stores all their CIDs. Your frontend then uses a smart video player that can automatically switch between these qualities based on the viewer's internet speed.
Why it wins: This demonstrates a deep understanding of what it takes to build a real-world, production-quality video application. It's a very polished feature that makes the user experience significantly better.











Part 3: The Flawless Demo
You win a hackathon with your demo.
Tell a Story: Start by explaining the problem: "Creators are losing control of their content and paying huge fees. Viewers face buffering and censorship. We've built a solution."
Live Demo, Not Slides: Show, don't tell. Open your app. Upload a short video clip live.
The Magic Moment: While it's "processing" (your backend is uploading to Filecoin), explain what's happening. Then, open a new browser tab, go to the video's page, and click play. It should start instantly. Pause here. Let the judges see it. Say, "That's FilCDN, delivering the video at incredible speed, secured by the Filecoin network."
Show the "Wow" Factor: Demo your chosen feature (live streaming, tipping, or adaptive bitrate). This is the climax of your presentation.
Clean Code: Have your GitHub repository ready and clean. A good README is essential.
Your architecture is solid. Your implementation plan is clear. Now, pick your "wow" feature, execute flawlessly, and you will be in a very strong position to win.












Request In: A user POSTs a video to your Express server.
Save: Multer saves the video to a temp file.
Process: Your code uses FFmpeg to generate a thumbnail.
Store: Your code uses the Synapse SDK to upload the processed video to Filecoin/FilCDN.
Record: Your code uses Prisma to save the returned CID and other metadata into your SQLite database file.
Cleanup: Your code deletes the temporary video files from your server's disk.
Respond: Your Express server sends a "Success" message back to the user's browser.
